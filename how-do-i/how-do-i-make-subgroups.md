# How do I make subgroups?

Xena uses the search and highlight feature to make subgroups

![Where the search feature is located](../.gitbook/assets/highlightlocation%20%282%29.png)

As you type Xena will search all the data on the screen for your values and then highlight those that match. 

You may need 'AND' or 'OR' to divide your samples. [This help page](https://ucsc-xena.gitbook.io/project/overview-of-features/filter-and-subgrouping#supported-search-terms) details a complete list of all the search terms we support. 

After all the samples that you want to put in one subgroup are highlighted, you use the highlight menu to create a new column.

## Example

Below is a demo of this in TCGA Lower Grade Glioma. We are going to create a subgroup of samples that have a nonsense or frameshift mutation in ATRX and another subgroup of those that do not.

This new subgroup column can then be used for a KM analysis \(use the column menu\) or to [compare gene expression](https://ucsc-xena.gitbook.io/project/how-to-pages-1/how-do-i-compare-gene-expression-between-subgroups).
