 [Sample highlight Example 1:]() highlight samples of specific sample IDs, such as THR30\_0820\_S01 or THR30\_0861\_S01

 [Sample highlight Example 2:]() highlight samples matching an arbitary criteria, such as TARGET samples

 [Sample filtering Example 1:]() specify \(filter to\) what samples to show in a view using a predicate, such as TARGET samples

 [Sample filtering Example 2:]() specify samples in a view using a predicate that includes a boolean term, such as TARGET and TCGA samples \(use boolean OR\)

 [Sample filtering and highlight at the same time:]() specify samples in a view using a predicate \(e.g. just show TARGET samples\), as well as highlight specific samples by IDs, such as TARGET-40-0A4I6O-01A-01R

 [Sample filtering using data in a hidden filter column:]() useful when you want to filter samples using data not displayed on the screen. You can use HIDDEN FILTER COLUMN. For exmaple, filter the samples to &lt; 5 years old, but you don't want to actually display the age column on the screen.
